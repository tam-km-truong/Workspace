# TL;DR Guide: Backpressure, Concurrency & Memory Management in Python

---

## 1. **What is Backpressure?**

- **Backpressure** means slowing down or pausing input when your program can’t keep up with the data rate.
    
- Prevents system overload, memory bloat, and crashes (including **OOM**).
    
- Essential when dealing with streams, pipelines, or heavy concurrent workloads.
    

---

## 2. **Concurrency Basics**

- **Concurrency** lets your program do multiple things at once, improving throughput and responsiveness.
    
- Two main models in Python:
    
    - **ThreadPoolExecutor**: Uses threads; best for I/O-bound tasks (e.g., file/network operations).
        
    - **ProcessPoolExecutor**: Uses separate processes; best for CPU-bound tasks (heavy computation).

## 3. **Choosing Threads vs Processes**

|Task Type|Use ThreadPoolExecutor|Use ProcessPoolExecutor|
|---|---|---|
|I/O-bound|Reading/writing files, network calls|Usually unnecessary|
|CPU-bound|Not efficient due to Python GIL|Best choice for CPU-heavy operations|

## 4. **Managing Tasks with Executors**

- Use `executor.submit()` to schedule tasks; it returns a **Future** (a placeholder for the result).
    
- Too many pending futures cause memory issues and overload.
    
- Control concurrency by:
    
    - Limiting **max_workers**.
        
    - Limiting how many futures you submit at once (e.g., submit 50, wait for some to finish, then submit more).
        

---

## 5. **Backpressure Control Patterns**

### a. Limit pending jobs:

```python
max_pending = 50
pending = set()

for item in items:
    while len(pending) >= max_pending:
        done, pending = wait(pending, return_when=FIRST_COMPLETED)
    future = executor.submit(do_work, item)
    pending.add(future)
```

- Prevents memory overload by never letting too many jobs queue up.
    

### b. Use Bounded Queues:

- Producers put data into a queue with `maxsize`.
    
- Consumers take data at a rate they can handle.
    
- When queue is full, producer **blocks** — natural backpressure.

## 6. **What is OOM (Out Of Memory)?**

- Happens when your program requests more RAM than available.
    
- Can crash your program or trigger OS-level killing.
    
- Causes:
    
    - Loading huge files into memory at once.
        
    - Creating too many concurrent tasks.
        
    - Memory leaks.
        

---

## 7. **Tips to Avoid OOM and Overload**

- **Stream data** instead of loading fully (use generators, `yield`).
    
- **Batch processing:** process in small chunks, don’t read entire files at once.
    
- Limit concurrency (`max_workers` and pending jobs).
    
- Monitor memory usage.
    
- Close files and release resources promptly.
    
- Use async I/O (`asyncio`) for high I/O concurrency.
    
- Request sufficient memory on clusters and handle job size accordingly.
    

---

## 8. **Summary: Best Practices**

- Pick executor type according to task type (I/O vs CPU bound).
    
- Limit the number of tasks queued or running concurrently.
    
- Implement backpressure using queues or submission limits.
    
- Use streaming and batch processing to manage memory.
    
- Monitor your system for signs of overload or OOM.
