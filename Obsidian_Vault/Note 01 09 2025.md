Goal for next meeting: slides for next monday
Short intro with specific problem formulation

general form for batching in phylogenetic compression

our heuristical form (order + separators)
axis 1
slide about the order. heuriscally a set of unorder genomes and put it into order
new version completely
3 questions on the white board
impact of sampling: fraction, fixed, random, nth accession

axis 2:
properly formulating the problem
input 
the specific compression scheme
and output
an order and we want to put seperators.
output: partitions of the genomes
