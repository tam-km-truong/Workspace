This experiment aims to construct the phylogenetic order for all Sal. enterica from the 661k collection

We have the phylogenetic order for 100k genomes

So we need to only insert the remaining genomes into the 100k tree

The following steps are required:

Sketch 100k genomes in the skeleton tree sketch size 1000

calculate the distances from the remaining gennomes to the sketch size

get the minimum distance leave for each remaining genome
